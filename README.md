This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios in Python. The first involves an OverflowError that can occur when performing arithmetic operations with very large and very small floating-point numbers. The second involves a KeyError that arises when trying to access a non-existent key in a dictionary.  The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` offers improved error handling and alternative approaches.
